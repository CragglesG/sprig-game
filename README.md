# The Knight
This is a really simple Sprig game that I made to try out the Sprig engine and dabble with 2D games.
It includes 3 main levels, followed by 2 that are shown if you take the wrong path, and 3 levels that are for displaying text if you take the right path.

The aim of the game is to escape your captor's castle, it is a puzzle game.

## Arcade Disclaimer
I did not use anybody else's code making this game.
However, I did use the in-built AI once, to ask how I would go about pausing my code. I did not copy and paste the output, I only used it as advice to write my own code.

**Thanks for reviewing my project!**
