# The Knight
This is a really simple Sprig game that I made to try out the Sprig engine and dabble with 2D games.

It includes 3 main levels, 2 that are shown if you take the wrong path, and 3 levels that are for displaying text when you complete the game. There are 3 possible mistakes that you can make (all very costly, you'll end up wasting a **lot** of time if you make them) and only one correct path.

The aim of the game is to escape your captor's castle, it is a puzzle game.
